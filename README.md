<h2 stlye = "font-family: Arial">Motivation</h2>

<p style = "font-family: Arial">
Noticing my growing expenses, I aimed to perform data analysis on the dataset of my monthly spending over the year of 2022 to help provide insight into how to decrease my spending. To do so, I used Seaborn, Matplot, NumPy, and Pandas to visualize the data and its different aspects. Moreover, I set out to create a linear regression model via the SciKit Learn library to forecast my monthly spending in January and February of 2023 (Spoiler: It's not looking good for me).

<h2 style = "font-family: Arial"> Collecting Data</h2>

<p style = "font-family: Arial">
From Personal Bank Statements, I'm able to collect information which varied by regular intervals of time. After parsing through such data in Excel and cleaning null transactions, I had a clean Univariate Time Series, which I then imported into my Jupyter Notebook.

<h2 style = "font-family: Arial"> Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model</h2>

<p style = "font-family: Arial">
Using Python, I was able to categorize the data based upon Purpose. As in, from which sectors
in my life does the expenditure originate from? <br> By using such visualizations, I was able to identify various trends in my spending habits. Doing such motivated the desire to develop a projection of my spendings in January and February of 2023. I wanted to see if my trend predictions would persist based on the ML's findings. <br> After ensuring that the data is normally distributable, I created a linear regression model to forecast the data for additional time intervals using Python's SciKit Learn Library. Consider viewing the project to learn more about the insights and conclusions that the Model was able to provide.

<h2 style = "font-family: Arial"> Learning + Future Developments</h2>
<p style = "font-family: Arial">
I aim to return to this project at the end of February to see variances between actual increases or decreases in monthly spendings versus the model's predictions.<br>From this project, I was able to practice my data analysis thinking, as well as my ability to visualize data using various Python libraries. This was also my first time using Reveal.JS to design information found in Jupyter Notebooks.
